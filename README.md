> Vue.js server-side rendering middleware for Express.js.

<img src="logo.png" height="60" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />

This package provides production-ready server-side [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) application rendering middleware for [Express.js](http://expressjs.com). It creates a new instance of [VueRender](https://github.com/xpepermint/vue-builder#api) class (provided by the [vue-builder](https://github.com/xpepermint/express-vue-builder) dependency) and installs it to the request object as `req.vue` variable.

This is an open source package for [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) and [Express.js](http://expressjs.com). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xpepermint/express-vue-builder) where you can also find our [issue tracker](https://github.com/xpepermint/express-vue-builder/issues).

## Install

Run the command below to install the package.

```
$ npm install --save express-vue-builder vue-builder
```

## Usage

Before we deploy application in production, we need to compile our Vue.js application into a bundle. A bundle is simply a file holding application's source code. Because we would like to render application in browsers as well as on the server, we need to build two bundle files - one targeting browsers, the other targeting the server. Check the attached example on how to build a bundle. Check the documentation of the [vue-builder](https://github.com/xpepermint/express-vue-builder) package for details.

Once you've created the bundle file for server-side, you can create a middleware.

```js
const {bundleRenderer} = require('express-vue-builder');

let middleware = bundleRenderer(`./dist/server/bundle.js`); // pass this to app.use() of your Express application
```

Check the included `./example` directory or run the `npm run example` command to start the sample application.
